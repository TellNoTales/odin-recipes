    <h3>How to prepare a delectable chocolate mousse with a few ingredients!</h3>
    <p>Chocolate Mousse may well be the ultimate chocolate fix! Rich and creamy, yet light and fluffy, one pot is
        satisfying but always leaves me wanting more.
        This is a classic chocolate mousse made the proper French way, as served in fine dining restaurants. Less
        cream, more chocolate, a more intense chocolate flavour and a beautiful creamy mouth feel.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Chocolate</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps to Follow</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat egg whites and sugar until foamy.</li>
            <li>Soft peaks, it should be foamy but have SOFT peaks that flop at the top, as pictured above, no
                standing upright.</li>
            <li>Whip cream.</li>
            <li>Fold together cream and egg yolks.</li>
            <li>Fold in melted chocolate.</li>
            <li>Fold egg whites into chocolate mixture. Don’t beat furiously – that’s the sure fire way to a pot
                of liquid chocolate!</li>
            <li>Spoon into individual pots or a larger dish, chill until firm.</li>
        </ol>
